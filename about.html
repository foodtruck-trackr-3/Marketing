        <section>
          <p>
            FoodTruckTracker is the best way for owners and customers to meet together. We allow
            customers to know where their favorite food trucks are at currently, as well as see a
            schedule of where they will be.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Owners are able to keep customers informed of their current menu and any specials that
            are running. We also allow owners to update any of their information quickly and easily.
